# Tailwind CSS Classes Not Working
This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Tailwind CSS: classes not being applied despite seemingly correct installation and import.

## Problem
The provided code shows a basic React component that attempts to use Tailwind classes (`bg-red-500`, `p-4`).  However, these classes have no effect, and the element remains without any styling from Tailwind CSS.

## Solution
The solution involves carefully checking the following:

1. **Correct Import Order:** Ensure that `tailwindcss/tailwind.css` is imported *after* your custom CSS file. The order of imports matters; Tailwind needs to be loaded after base styles.
2. **Build Process (if applicable):** If you are using a build process (like Webpack, Parcel, etc.), make sure it's configured to correctly process Tailwind CSS.
3. **Purge Unused Styles (if applicable):**  If using `purge`, ensure that all your components' classes are included in the purge configuration.
4. **PostCSS Configuration:** Ensure that PostCSS is properly set up and integrated into your project.

This repository provides a corrected `bugSolution.js` that addresses the issue, showcasing the correct import order.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` (or your preferred development server command).
